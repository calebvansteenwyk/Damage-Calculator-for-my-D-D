This is a pretty simple damage calculator for a D&D campaign I am running.

It takes in the type of dice and number of that dice used for damage. 
(ex: a move might have a damage of 6 6-sided dice, or 6d6).
It then takes in the attacker's attack statistic and the defender's defense statistic, 
rolls the correct type and number of dice, uses the attack and defense to add and subtract
to the rolled damage, and displays the total damage. It also gives an option for 
not using the defense, for moves that specifically ignore the enemy's defense.
